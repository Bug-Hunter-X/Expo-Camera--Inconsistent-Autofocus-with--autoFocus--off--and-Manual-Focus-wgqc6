The original `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code that doesn't reliably focus the camera.  The solution in `bugSolution.js` adds a timeout of 100 milliseconds, which appears to solve the problem in many cases:

```javascript
// bug.js (Problematic code)
Camera.setCameraParamsAsync({ focus: { mode: 'auto' }});
// bugSolution.js (Solution with timeout)
setTimeout(() => {
  Camera.setCameraParamsAsync({ focus: { mode: 'auto' } });
}, 100);
```
This simple addition seems to give the camera the time it needs to change focus reliably.  It is not an ideal fix and the root cause is still unknown. More investigation is needed to completely resolve this intermittent bug.
